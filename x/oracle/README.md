## Abstract

The Oracle module provides the Sei blockchain with up-to-date and accurate price feeds.

As price information is extrinsic to the blockchain, the Sei network relies on validators to periodically vote on the prices.

> Since the Oracle service is powered by validators, you may find it interesting to look at the [Staking](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/x/staking/spec/README.md) module, which covers the logic for staking and validators.
